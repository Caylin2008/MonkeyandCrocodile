Story:
There was a monkey that lived in a tree with very sweet fruits.  
Everyday he shared the fruits with his friend the crocodile.  
The crocodile would bring home the fruit to his wife and she loved it.
One day, the crocodile's wife asked the crocodile to bring the monkey's heart because it must be sweet from all the fruit.
The crocodile got the monkey and on the way back to the crocodile's house the crocodile told the monkey what his wife had planned.
Then the monkey tricked the crocodile into going back to the fruit tree and said that the crocodile betrayed him.
